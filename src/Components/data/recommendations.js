    - Refactoring parts of our Ruby codebase
    - Helped in introducing new services in Python

    text: `I had the pleasure of working as a product manager with Sachin during our time at Heyjobs. He is the kind of engineer who consistently goes the extra mile.

      He wasn't limiting himself to getting tickets done; he was invested in making sure every project and feature we shipped was polished and worked perfectly.

      Sachin has a real talent for seeing the bigger picture beyond just writing good code. He understands that a successful launch depends on all the moving parts working together. He would take over QA, collaborate closely with operation managers, and always seemed one step ahead, spotting and fixing potential problems proactively. 

      One of the things I really appreciated about working with Sachin was his ability to communicate complex technical stuff clearly. He was great at communicating within the team and actively talking to our external partners when needed, making those relationships stronger.`,

    text: `I had the pleasure of working with Sachin as an external engineer in our Integration team. His exceptional ability to bridge our backend systems with third-party tools like Channable, combined with his deep technical knowledge, made him an invaluable team member.

      What truly set Sachin apart was his holistic approach to engineering. He not only excelled in technical implementation but consistently demonstrated a keen interest in understanding the underlying business processes, proactively proposing meaningful improvements to our setup. His contributions were instrumental in both integrating new ATS systems and completely revamping our integration infrastructure.

      Sachin consistently displayed a growth mindset, eagerly expanding his knowledge in unfamiliar areas, while remaining remarkably reliable and straightforward in his communication. His technical expertise, business acumen, and collaborative spirit would be an asset to any organization. I highly recommend Sachin for any technical role requiring both deep integration expertise and strategic thinking.`,
